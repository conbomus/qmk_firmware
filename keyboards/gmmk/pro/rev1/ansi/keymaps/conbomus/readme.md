# Description
The main goal I had for this keymap was to make the encoder nicely multi-functional.

## Main Encoder Changes:
1. Pressing the encoder will toggle between 2 states: Scroll Mode and Arrow Mode (Default)
2. In arrow mode, the encoder will arrow to the left and right
3. In arrow while holding CTRL, the encoder will arrow up and down
4. In scroll mode, the encoder will behave as a vertical scroll
5. In scroll mode while holding CTRL, the encoder will behave as a horizontal scroll

## Misc Changes:
1. Caps lock indicator in red
2. Cut, Copy, and Paste shortcuts all on the right side of the board
3. Changed Page Down to be Home
